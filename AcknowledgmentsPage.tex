This work, although ultimately channeled through me, is truly the product of the best advising, guidance, and overall support that anyone could hope for.
I have been very lucky to have had mentors, teachers, colleagues, friends, and family that have guided and shaped the journey through my graduate studies and have given me much more than I deserve.
There are too many to name here, and if you are omitted, know that it is not because I have forgotten you, but because the task of thanking everyone who deserves it is more than I am capable of. 

I must first thank my two advisors, Dr.~John Bardsley and Dr.~Aaron Luttman, whose vision, generosity with ideas, and guidance have not only shaped this work into what it is, but also me as a mathematician.
They set me right when I was lost and pushed me forward and encouraged me when the ideas were good.
They  graciously and patiently guided me along the path to becoming a mathematical researcher each in their own distinctly valuable way, and I have a unique skill set and perspective because of them, which I am truly grateful for.

The members of my committee deserve much thanks, not only for their input in this work, but also, and likely more importantly, for their advice and tutelage over my time at the University of Montana.
Dr.~Jon Graham instilled in me a solid appreciation for statistical thought and his unrelenting dedication to teaching was an inspiration.
Dr.~Peter Golubtsov was very generous with ideas and advice that have had a great influence on the direction of the work, and his insights and answers to my questions in courses and discussions were invaluable.
Lastly, Dr.~Leonid Kalechev guided me not just a teacher and mentor, but also as a diligent and expertly capable department chair for three of my four years at UM.

I must also thank Dr.~Jen Brooks, whose early influence and encouragement taught me to be ever vigilant in the face of theoretical difficulties, for the fruits that they bear have been truly worth the effort.
Many thanks to the other members of the analysis group, Dr.~Greg St.~George, Dr.~Karl Stroetoff, and the late Dr.~Thomas Tonev for the useful insights I gained in their seminar and in preparation for the analysis preliminary exam.
Also, thanks to the current department chair and former graduate chair, Dr.~Emily Stone and to the current graduate chair, Dr.~Cory Palmer without whose leadership and help I would not have made it through.

I am very gratefule to have been financially supported from a Site Direct Research and Development grant from National Security Technologies LLC and the Mathematical Sciences department at the University of Montana.
This support made this work possible.
Also, the friendly staff at the Kettlehouse Southside provided many a beverage and listening ear when emotional currency was low.

Finally, the most thanks is due to those who supported me emotionally and personally through this journey.  
I am eternally grateful, as it is the relationships that I've built these last four years that I value more than anything else that I have gained.
Thanks to those who were at one time or another, a fellow student with me for all the helpful conversations, mathematical or otherwise, but mostly, the camaraderie and collegiality that made the experience of graduate school in Missoula truly unique.
In particular, to Dr.~Cody Palmer, Nhan Ngyuyen, Charlie Katerba, Dr.~Marylesa Howard: with you, I have made life-long friends. 
I cannot express the magnitude of my gratitude to my close friends and family outside of mathematics -- your value has and ever shall be beyond my ability to quantify -- Dayne Robinson, Lora Weitzel, Alexis Billings, Corinne Casolar, Justin van Almelo, and Christa Carleton.
To my family, and especially Mom, Dad, and Abbey: you are my core and my everlasting support; without you I would be lost.

This manuscript is dedicated to the memory of Paul Joyce, whose brilliance and grace were taken from us too early.
